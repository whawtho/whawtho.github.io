###Professional Self-Assessment

My Computer Science degree has given me a strong foundation in software development, problem solving, and secure design. I entered the program with years of experience in industrial automation and controls, and I originally thought computer science would only support my day to day work in small ways. Over time, I learned that software engineering principles directly support how modern automation systems are designed, connected, and maintained. Because of this, the program has helped me grow both as a developer and as a controls engineer. Throughout the program, I gained experience with software engineering, data structures, algorithms, and secure coding practices. The artifacts I selected for my ePortfolio show how these skills developed over time and how they align with the program outcomes.
My first artifact is the Contact Service project from CS 320. I enhanced it by adding a search feature, improving validation, and expanding unit test coverage. This showed my ability to design and extend software systems in a structured way while following clear requirements. It also demonstrates my understanding of quality assurance and maintainability in software design.

My second artifact is the C++ encryption program from CS 405. The original version only performed basic XOR encryption. I improved the algorithm structure, added better validation, and cleaned up the input handling. This enhancement showed that I can evaluate and implement computing solutions using algorithmic thinking. It also reinforced the idea that even simple algorithms can benefit from careful design choices.

My third artifact builds on the encryption project to meet the database requirement. I replaced the loose output file system with a structured flat file design that behaves more like a simple database table. My environment made SQLite difficult to implement, so I created a controlled, field based storage format that organizes multiple records, supports persistence, and simulates basic retrieval. This showed that I can design a storage solution that meets practical constraints while still focusing on organization, consistency, and security of data.

One important skill I strengthened across all enhancements is a security mindset. In several courses, especially CS 405, I learned how to validate input, protect data, and anticipate flaws before they become failures. I applied these lessons by adding checks, improving structure, and making the code more stable and predictable. This program also improved how I communicate technical ideas. Through narratives, documentation, and the code review process, I learned to explain decisions more clearly. Communication is important in both software engineering and industrial automation because it helps teams avoid mistakes, align expectations, and support better long term maintenance.

Another important part of my growth came from recognizing how industrial automation and computer science are moving closer together. Operational Technology and Information Technology used to be separate worlds, but that is no longer the case. Modern automation systems use networked PLCs, industrial PCs, cloud dashboards, machine learning tools, and remote access platforms that depend heavily on IT concepts. Even basic tasks like data logging, historian storage, MQTT messaging, and REST API integration require software skills. Because of this shift, the Computer Science program gave me tools that apply directly to the direction the automation field is heading. The merging of OT and IT creates more opportunities for controls engineers who understand programming, data flow, and security, and it reinforces that my degree supports both my current work and future career growth.

Looking back at everything I have learned, I can see how each course contributed to my development. I have gained confidence in designing software systems, choosing the right data structures, securing data, and documenting my work. These skills apply directly to my career in industrial automation, and they also give me the option to take on more software heavy engineering roles in the future. My ePortfolio brings all of this together. It shows the enhancements I made, why I made them, and the skills I demonstrated as I worked through each one. It represents my development as a computer science professional and the value this degree brings to my work and career.
