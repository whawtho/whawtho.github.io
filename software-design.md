# Software Design and Engineering

The artifact I chose for this category is my Contact Management project from CS-320. It is a small Java application that stores basic contact information and includes JUnit tests to verify each feature. I originally created it in June 2024 as part of the module project focused on testing, validation, and basic object-oriented design.

I selected this artifact because it already had a solid structure, and it gave me a good foundation to build on for a meaningful enhancement. The new search function I added expands the original program in a practical way and better reflects real-world software needs. Adding search required updating the service class with new logic, handling string matching, and writing new JUnit tests to confirm the behavior. This enhancement shows safely modifying existing code, adding new features without breaking anything, and keep everything fully tested.

The enhancement lines up with the outcomes I planned to meet back in Module One. It demonstrates software design skills, problem-solving, and the ability to improve an existing system using clean, well-structured logic. I don’t have any changes to my outcome coverage plan at this point. Everything I planned to meet fits with the work I ended up doing.

While enhancing this artifact, I was able to revisit old code with fresh eyes and see areas that could be improved. I learned how important it is to think about how users will interact with even a simple program. The new search feature seems small, but it helped me see how even small additions can affect tests, data handling, and future expandability. The biggest challenge was making sure the feature was flexible enough to search multiple fields without overcomplicating the code. I also had to keep the tests clear and simple so they would be easy to maintain later. Overall, the enhancement helped reinforce basic design principles and gave me a reminder of how incremental improvements can strengthen a project.
